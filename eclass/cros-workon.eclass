# @BLURB: helper eclass for building ChromiumOS packages from git
# @DESCRIPTION:
# A lot of ChromiumOS packages (src/platform/ and src/third_party/) are
# managed in the same way.  You've got a git tree and you want to build
# it.  This automates a lot of that common stuff in one place.

# Array variables. All of the following variables can contain multiple items
# with the restriction being that all of them have to have either:
# - the same number of items globally
# - one item as default for all
# - no items as the cros-workon default
# The exceptions are:
# - CROS_WORKON_PROJECT has to have all items specified.
# - CROS_WORKON_TREE is not listed here because it may not have the same number
#   of items as other array variables when CROS_WORKON_SUBTREE is used.
#   See the variable description below for more details.
ARRAY_VARIABLES=( CROS_WORKON_{SUBTREE,REPO,PROJECT,LOCALNAME,DESTDIR,COMMIT} )

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_SUBTREE
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Subpaths of the source checkout to be used in the build, separated by
# whitespace. Normally this will be set to directories, but files are also
# allowed if necessary.
# Default value is an empty string, meaning the whole source checkout is used.
# It is strongly recommended to set this variable if the source checkout
# contains multiple packages (e.g. platform2) to avoid unnecessary uprev when
# unrelated files in the repository are modified.
# Access to files outside of these subpaths will be denied.
: ${CROS_WORKON_SUBTREE:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_REPO
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The base git URL to locate the remote repository.  This is usually the root of
# the GoB server.  It could be any git server, but for infra reliability, our
# policy is to only refer to servers we maintain (e.g. googlesource.com).
# It is combined with CROS_WORKON_PROJECT to form the full URL.
# Look at the cros-constants eclass for common values.
: ${CROS_WORKON_REPO:=/mnt/src}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_PROJECT
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The path on the remote server (beneath CROS_WORKON_REPO) to find the git repo.
# This has no relationship to where the source is checked out locally in the
# manifest.  If looking at a manifest.xml, this is the "name" attribute of the
# "project" tag.
: ${CROS_WORKON_PROJECT:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_LOCALNAME
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The relative path in the local manifest checkout to find the local git
# checkout.  The exact path it is relative to depends on the CATEGORY of the
# ebuild.  For chromeos-base packages, this is relative to src/.  For all other
# packages, it is relative to src/third_party/.  This applies to all ebuilds
# regardless of the overlay they live in.
# If looking at a manifest.xml, this is related to the "path" attribute of the
# "project" tag (although that path is relative to the root of the manifest).
: ${CROS_WORKON_LOCALNAME:=${PN}}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_DESTDIR
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Destination directory in ${WORKDIR} for checkout. It must be under ${S}.
# Note that the default is ${S}, but is only referenced in src_unpack for
# ebuilds that would like to override it.
: ${CROS_WORKON_DESTDIR:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_COMMIT
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Git commit hashes of the source repositories.
# It is guaranteed that files identified by tree hashes in CROS_WORKON_TREE
# can be found in the commit.
# CROW_WORKON_COMMIT is updated only when CROS_WORKON_TREE below is updated,
# so it does not necessarily point to HEAD in the source repository.
: ${CROS_WORKON_COMMIT:=master}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_TREE
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Git tree hashes of the contents of the source repositories.
# If CROS_WORKON_SUBTREE is set, tree hashes are taken from specified subpaths;
# otherwise, they are taken from the root directories of the source
# repositories. Therefore note that CROS_WORKON_TREE may have different number
# of entries than CROS_WORKON_COMMIT if multiple subpaths are specified in
# CROS_WORKON_SUBTREE.
# This is used for verifying the correctness of prebuilts. Unlike the commit
# hash, this hash is unaffected by the history of the repository, or by
# commit messages.
: ${CROS_WORKON_TREE:=}

# Scalar variables. These variables modify the behaviour of the eclass.

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_SUBDIRS_TO_COPY
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Make cros-workon operate exclusively with the subtrees given by this array.
# NOTE: This only speeds up local_cp builds. Inplace/local_git builds are unaffected.
# It will also be disabled by using project arrays, rather than a single project.
: ${CROS_WORKON_SUBDIRS_TO_COPY:=/}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_SUBDIRS_TO_REV
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Array of directories in the source tree. If defined, this causes this ebuild
# to only uprev if there are changes within the specified subdirectories.
: ${CROS_WORKON_SUBDIRS_TO_REV:=/}
